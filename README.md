# Portfolio
Work-In-Progress

## Languages I usually work with
Java, Python, Kotlin, Go, Javascript, C++, Rust </br>
_I recently started to learn RUST as a C++ replacement._

## Interests
TBD

## Personal Projects
Out of personal interest or to improve my skills or knowledge I worked/I am working on the following projects.

### NLG Server
https://github.com/Kai-Karren/nlg-server </br>
An example for a Naturual Language Generation (NLG) Server that can be used to separate the response management from the dialogue engine.
Uses Rasa's NLG Server API.

### SDE (Java, Kotlin)
**Closed source**</br>
Simple Dialogue Engine (SDE) is my personal dialogue engine that I use for personal experiments with focus on simplicity. It is based things I learned while working on VUISA and StoryBot.

### DE Action Servers (Kotlin, Go)
**Closed source**</br>
I implemented some dialogue engine actions servers that can be used as Action Servers for Rasa-based Dialogue Engines.

## University Projects
As part of my study program I worked on the following projects that I think are worth mentioning.
All of them are closed source.

### CG Ray Tracer (C++)
As part of the computer graphics core lecture that I took in my bachelor studies, I implemented a ray tracer together with my team partner Marc Ruble.
This was my first major encounter with C++ in a larger project. 

Some images that have been rendered with the ray tracer can be found on my entry page in the [rendering competition of CG WS2017/2018](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/courses/cg1-2017/RC/Karren_web/)

### Low-Level DB (C++)
As project of the Database System core lecture from Prof. Jens Dittrich, I implemented a (low-level) database from the ground up in C++. This included to implement different data layouts like row- and column-store, hybrid-store-approaches, as well as indexes like BTrees and data compression to improve access times in the performnce competions where multiple 100,000 rows were inserted into the DB and queries were executed in the data.

### StoryBot (Java, Python)
A dialogue engine for interactive story telling with Chatbots. Uses the Twee story format and some additional macros from Twine 2.0.

### Automatic Shutter (Arduino)
A shutter system that can be controlled with a mobile APP. Including schedules and light-level dependent changes.

### 2D Racing Game (Java)
In the software project of my bachelor studies, I implemented a 2D racing game with multiplayer support in a larger group. In the second part each of us implemented an AI for a car that had to complete different tracks and our AIs competed withanother and with the ones from other teams in a turnament.

### VUISA
VUISA which stands for Voice User Interface using Sentiment Analysis is a framework I implemented for my bachelor thesis. It allows to create phone-based VUIs that can analyse the user's sentiment/emotions with a self-trained classifier. Based on the classified emotions, the dialogue control is able to adapt to the user depending on the dialogue flow.
