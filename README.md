### CG Ray Tracer (C++)
**Closed source**
As part of the computer graphics core lecture that I took in my bachelor studies, I implemented a ray tracer together with my team partner Marc Ruble.
This was my first major encounter with C++ in a larger project. 

Some images that have been rendered with the ray tracer can be found on my entry page in the [rendering competition of CG WS2017/2018](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/courses/cg1-2017/RC/Karren_web/)

### Low-Level DB (C++)
**Closed source**
As project of the Database System core lecture from Prof. Jens Dittrich, I implemented a (low-level) database from the ground up in C++. This included to implement different data layouts like row- and column-store, hybrid-store-approaches, as well as indexes like BTrees and data compression to improve access times in the performnce competions where multiple 100,000 rows were inserted into the DB and queries were executed in the data.

### StoryBot (Java, Python)
**Closed source**
TBD

### Automatic Shutter (Arduino)
**Closed source**
TBD
